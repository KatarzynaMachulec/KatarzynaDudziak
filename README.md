# Hi there, I'm Katarzyna Machulec! 

#### Enthusiastic self-taught developer, eager to enhance tech skills and learn from more experienced developers. Until now I have worked on the Django projects, contributed to the Android app (using Java), and created the desktop app where I used the speech-recognition feature. In the meantime, I became familiar with the UnitTests, git workflow, and Linux. Currently, I am diving deep into the Docker environment.
